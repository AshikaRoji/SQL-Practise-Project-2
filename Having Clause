/*
Using Having Clause
we are going to group all jobtitles together with their count and then find out count(jobtitle)>1
*/

SELECT JobTitle , Count(JobTitle) AS CountOfJobTitle
FROM SQLTutorial.dbo.EmployeeDemographics
JOIN SQLTutorial.dbo.EmployeeSalary
ON EmployeeDemographics.EmployeeID = EmployeeSalary.EmployeeID
WHERE Count(JobTitle) > 1
GROUP BY JobTitle

ERROR : THe above query will give you error :  
An aggregate may not appear in the WHERE clause unless it is in a subquery contained in a 
HAVING clause or a select list, and the column being aggregated is an outer reference.

Another wrong Query :

SELECT JobTitle , Count(JobTitle) AS CountOfJobTitle
FROM SQLTutorial.dbo.EmployeeDemographics
JOIN SQLTutorial.dbo.EmployeeSalary
ON EmployeeDemographics.EmployeeID = EmployeeSalary.EmployeeID
HAVING Count(JobTitle) > 1
GROUP BY JobTitle

The above query gives error because we cannot use having clause unless the aggregate function works first

Incorrect syntax near the keyword 'GROUP'.

CORRECTED QUERY:

SELECT JobTitle , Count(JobTitle) AS CountOfJobTitle
FROM SQLTutorial.dbo.EmployeeDemographics
JOIN SQLTutorial.dbo.EmployeeSalary
ON EmployeeDemographics.EmployeeID = EmployeeSalary.EmployeeID

GROUP BY JobTitle
HAVING Count(JobTitle) > 1
ORDER BY COUNT(JobTitle)

OUTPUT
--------

Accountant	2
Salesman	3
