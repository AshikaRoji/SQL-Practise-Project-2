SELECT *

--Subqery in Select

SELECT EmployeeID,Salary, (SELECT avg(salary) FROM EmployeeSalary) AS AvgSal
FROM EmployeeSalary

SELECT EmployeeID,Salary, Avg(Salary) over () AS AvgSal
FROM EmployeeSalary

SELECT EmployeeID,Salary, Avg(Salary)  AS AvgSal
FROM EmployeeSalary
GROUP BY EmployeeId, Salary 
Order By  1, 2

SELECT a.EmployeeID , AvgSal
FROM (SELECT EmployeeID, Salary, Avg(Salary) over () AS AvgSal
      FROM EmployeeSalary) a


--Subquery in Where

SELECT EmployeeID,JobTitle, Salary
FROM EmployeeSalary
WHERE EmployeeID in (
	Select EmployeeID
	from EmployeeDemographics
